# Awesome chinese learning resources [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)
Those resources are often free, but it is well worth it to buy some of them.

## Learning Hanzi
[Hacking Chinese articles on characters](https://www.hackingchinese.com/my-best-advice-on-how-to-learn-chinese-characters/) is a great guide on many topics about learning 汉字.

[Outliers Chines Caracters Masterclass](https://www.outlier-linguistics.com/collections/chinese/products/how-to-learn-chinese-characters) a condensed and well-thought course about the structure behind the chinese writing system.

## Dictionaries
[Pleco](https://www.pleco.com/) is the go-to app. I recommend the professional bundle (worth more than buying any paper dictionary, especially with OCR and handwriting).

[The outlier dictionary](https://www.outlier-linguistics.com/collections/chinese/products/outlier-dictionary-of-chinese-characters) is a one-of-a kind dictionary that breaks down the components of characters.

[现代汉语规范词典](https://store.pleco.com/products.php) for intermediate learners, where its great explanations help with similar words.

## Flashcards
[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) - the classic flashcard program for spaced repetition,
with apps for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android (free) and IOS (paid)

## Grammar
[Allsetlearning Grammar wiki](https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/) Simply the best free resource for grammar.

## Pronounciation
[Sinosplice's pronounciation guide](https://www.sinosplice.com/learn-chinese/pronunciation-of-mandarin-chinese/) is just great. They also now have updated paid material.

## Graded readers
I particularly recommend those without pinyin on top of the 汉字, e.g the

[Mandarin Companion series](https://mandarincompanion.com/) with many great stories adapted to chinese,

[Imagine8press](https://imagin8press.com/) with classics like 西游记, half of the books are pinyin but still very useful.

## Podcasts

[Learning chinese through stories / LCTS / 听故事学中文](https://learningchinesethroughstories.com/) is an immersive podcast using only chinese, telling stories, explaining vocabulary in chinese, with many different levels.

## Misc
[Hinative](https://hinative.com) and [Italki](https://www.italki.com/post/question-103567) are two sites where you can ask for word differences, grammar questions and get native speakers to answer you.
