# Awesome chinese learning resources [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)
Those resources are often free, but it is well worth it to buy some of them.

## Learning Hanzi
[Outliers Course]() is the 
hacking chinese articles

## Dictionaries
Pleco is the go-to app. I recommend the professional bundle (worth more than buying any paper dictionary, especially with OCR and handwriting).

The outlier dictionary and Hanzi course gives excellent knowledge of the writing system (paid)
functional components

For intermediate learners where you will often be confused with similar words, I highly recommend Plecos version of the 现代汉语规范词典

## Flashcards
Anki - the classic flashcard program for spaced repetition,
with apps for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android (free) and IOS (paid)

## Grammar
[Allsetlearning Grammar wiki](https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/) Simply the best free resource for grammar.

## Pronounciation
https://www.sinosplice.com/learn-chinese/pronunciation-of-mandarin-chinese/

They also now have updated paid material at https://store.allsetlearning.com/

## Graded readers
I particularly recommend those without pinyin on top of the 汉字, e.g
the [Mandarin Companion series]().

Imagine8press (half of the book is pinyin, but still nice story)

## Podcasts

听故事学中文 a nice immersive podcast using only chinese

# Misc
hacking chinese best articles
(chinese forums new HSK pdf and lists)

hinative and italki are two sites where you can ask for word differences
